Entity-Relationship diagrams
----------------------------
When designing a database, we usually start with a higher-level model, then we convert it into relational model.
Entity-relationship model (E/R model): the structure of data is represented graphically

Entity is an abstract object, a collection of similar entities -> entity set
Properties of the entities -> attributes
Relationships are connections among two or more entity sets.
E/R diagram:
 Entity sets: rectangles
 Attributes: ovals (connected to the rectangle)
 Relationships: diamonds with lines to the connected entity sets

Multiplicity of binary E/R relationships
 many-one from E1 to E2: each member of E1 can be connected to at most one member of E2
 one-one: each member can be connected to exactly one member (in both directions)
 many-many: each member can be connected to one or more members (in both directions)
Arrows can be used to indicate multiplicity: arrow means "at most one"
Simple line means "one or more"
Rounded arrow means "exactly one"

Multiway relationships: relationships involving more than two entity sets
 (We can introduce a new entity set, instead.)
Roles in relationships: if one entity set appears two or more times in a relationship
 (each line to the entity set represents a different role)
Attributes on relationships
 (we can invent a new entity set instead of it)
Subclasses
 A "is a" B
Keys in the E/R model (any two distinct entities cannot have identical values for each attribute)
 (we underline key attributes in E/R model)
Referential integrity
 (A value appearing in one entity set must also appear in another.)
 --> rounded arrow means "exactly one"

Weak entity set (rectangle with a double border)
 If some key attributes belong to another entity set
 A weak entity set has some supporting entity sets and supporting relationships. 
 A supporting relationship is a binary, many-one relationship --> diamond with a double border

Converting an E/R model to relational
-------------------------------------
- From each entity set --> we create a relation with the same set of attributes
- relationship --> a relation whose attributes are the keys of the connected entity sets + attributes of the relationship
  (sometimes we must rename attributes to avoid name duplication)
- weak entity sets and subclasses need special handling
- sometimes we combine two relations into one
  (in case of a many-one relationship from E1 to E2: all attributes of E1, key attributes of E2, attributes of the relationship)

Weak entity set (W)
 relation for W: attributes of W + key attributes of the supporting entity sets
 a supporting relationship need not be converted

Subclass structures (3 methods)
1. E/R viewpoint 
   For each entity set E in the hierarchy, create a relation with key attributes from the root + attributes of E
2. Object-oriented viewpoint
   For each subtree, create a relation with all attributes of all entity sets in the subtree 
3. NULL value viewpoint
   One relation for the whole hierarchy with all attributes of all entity sets in the hierarchy
   Each entity is represented by one tuple (NULL value for attributes which the entity doesn't have)
